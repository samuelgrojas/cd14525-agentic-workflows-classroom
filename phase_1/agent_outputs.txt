Rome, Texas is a small unincorporated community located in Fannin County. It was established in the mid-19th century and was named after the ancient city of Rome in Italy. The community grew as a trading center for local farmers and eventually had a post office, school, and several businesses.

However, Rome never experienced significant growth and remained a small rural community. Today, Rome is a quiet area with a few historic buildings and a small population. It is known for its peaceful countryside and is a popular destination for those seeking a tranquil retreat.

Rome, Italy has a rich and extensive history dating back over 2,800 years. It was founded in 753 BC according to legend by Romulus and Remus, twin brothers who were raised by a she-wolf. Rome started as a small settlement and eventually grew into a powerful city-state, establishing itself as the capital of the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic, and later the Roman Empire.

During the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), Rome expanded its territory through conquest and colonization, becoming a dominant power in the Mediterranean region. The Republic eventually gave way to the Roman Empire under the rule of Emperor Augustus in 27 BC. The Roman Empire reached its peak under emperors such as Trajan and Hadrian, controlling vast territories and influencing culture, law, and architecture throughout Europe and beyond.

Rome's decline began in the 3rd century AD due to factors such as economic instability, political corruption, and invasions by barbarian tribes. The Western Roman Empire ultimately fell in 476 AD when the Germanic chieftain Odoacer deposed the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus.

Despite the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city of Rome remained a significant center of power and culture throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. It served as the capital of the Papal States from the 8th century until the unification of Italy in the 19th century.

Today, Rome is a vibrant and bustling city that attracts millions of visitors each year who come to admire its ancient ruins, stunning artwork, and rich history. It remains a symbol of the enduring legacy of one of the greatest civilizations in world history.
